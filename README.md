<br>
<h4> Courses </h4>

Through these trainings, I learned how to create my own webpage on GitHub and make it viewable to the public. I also learned how to navigate the GitHub workflow which took a bit of practice. I worked on creating, reviewing, and accepting pull requests as well as managing and resolving merge conflicts.

<ul>
  <li> I completed the course Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI on edX.org (below is the course overview). By completing this course, I learned how to upload and manipulate data, define relationships of data and edit queries. I also learned to connect to external data from sources like SQL on Azure. All of this culminated with me creating a custom dashboard from a set of assigned data. This dashboard was then shared to be used on various platforms. </li>

I leanred the basics of Amazon Management Console, Identity and Access Management (IAM), Virtual Private Cloud, Elastic Cloud Compute, Simple Storage Service, Simple Notification System, CloudWatch and CloudTrail management tools, and serverless computing.</li>
    <li>Through the AWS EC2 Management Console, I installed an OpenVPN Access Server. I then configured the server with various secruity settings, established an elastic IP address, and established an SSH connection through my local terminal. I had to make adjustments to the Key Pair permissions using the command line on my local terminal in order to properly connect to the OpenVPN server. Next, to test the server, I openned the server in my web browser to update a few settings and add users. Lastly, I connected to the VPN using the OpenVPN Connect client.
