Hi, I'm Colin Morgan; I am a MAcc student at the University of Tulsa. Here is a list of my technical skills!

<h3> Technical Skills </h3>

<details><summary>GitHub Learning Lab</summary>
<br> 
Below are courses I have completed on lab.github.com/courses:
</br>
<h4> Courses </h4>
<ul>
  <li> First Day on GitHub </li>
  <li> First Week on Github </li>
</ul>
Through these trainings, I learned how to create my own webpage on GitHub and make it viewable to the public. I also learned how to navigate the GitHub workflow which took a bit of practice. I worked on creating, reviewing, and accepting pull requests as well as managing and resolving merge conflicts.

<details><summary>Power BI + Dashboard</summary>
<br>
<ul>
<li> I completed the course Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI on edX.org (below is the course overview). By completing this course, I learned how to upload and manipulate data, define relationships of data and edit queries. I also learned to connect to external data from sources like SQL on Azure. All of this culminated with me creating a custom dashboard from a set of assigned data. This dashboard was then shared to be used on various platforms. </li>
