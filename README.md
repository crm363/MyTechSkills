  <li> I completed the course Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI on edX.org (below is the course overview). By completing this course, I learned how to upload and manipulate data, define relationships of data and edit queries. I also learned to connect to external data from sources like SQL on Azure. All of this culminated with me creating a custom dashboard from a set of assigned data. This dashboard was then shared to be used on various platforms. </li>
